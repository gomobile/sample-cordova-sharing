Cordova Social Sharing
======================

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for license terms and conditions.

Use the [Cordova social sharing plugin by Eddy Verbruggen][1] to “share” with
other apps such as Facebook\*, Twitter\*, SMS, email and other popular device
apps.

This app can be built for iOS, Android or Windows using the
[Intel XDK](http://xdk.intel.com).

Sharing causes native controls to appear, without having to leave the sample
app. Use the “share options” button to show a view of all sharing options
supported by this plugin that are available on the device.

An additional plugin named `cordova-plugin-queries-schemes` is included as
part of the sample to allow sharing to most popular apps when using iOS 9
devices, since additional permissions are required on that platform.
[See that plugin’s documentation][2] and `plugin.xml` file for additional
details and information.
